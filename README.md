## Contents

*Data are updated Monday - Friday.*

#### Upcoming change
:warning: From **2022-07-11, all data files** (`latest.csv`, `timeseries-*.csv`) **will have cases from the current outbreak, and from countries where MPXV is endemic**. The lists will be distinguished by the first letter of the ID, which will be of string type: **N** denoting cases from the current outbreak (equivalent to the current list), and **E** for cases from endemic countries.

This repository contains dated records of curated Monkeypox cases from the 2022 outbreak (April - ), a data dictionary, and a script used to pull contents from a spreadsheet into JSON and CSV files.

The script is intended for use by the curation team and supporting engineers. It requires access to the relevant Google Sheet, and a Google Cloud service account.

The data dictionary is located in the root directory of this project. It contains information about columns/fields in the data sets.

The archives folder contains dated JSON and CSV files. They are currently uploaded manually; regularly and automatically updated data sets live in an (currently private) S3 bucket.

There is also a daily briefing report generated from this data at https://www.monkeypox.global.health
